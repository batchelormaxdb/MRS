Mock Reservation System
This is a project that I worked on in college to learn and test various Bash processes. It is a full GUI reservation system for an airport, that takes user input and reserves a flight for them based on the information they provide. There are various methods used to prevent errors from occuring, such as same city flights, departing before or after today, etc.
Thank you for reading!
